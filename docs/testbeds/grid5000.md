# Grid5000

The provisioning of Grid5000 machines is done via a script `ouigo` provided in this repository.
It is intended to be run on the machines inside of grid5000  though it can be sufficiently modified to work on machines outside of the network.

## Request a Grid5000 Account

An explanation of how to get an account, and under which conditions you are eligible to do so, can be found on the [Grid5000 Wiki](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Get_an_account).
The current accounts used by the SCION-Team lie in the `misc` group.

The associated Research Project should be named as `SCIONLab`.

## Connect to the Grid5000 Frontend

The Grid5000 infrastructure is managed via the Grid5000 Intranet, an easy access is provided ssh infrastructure.
To connect simply use the id file provided to Grid5000 registration process.

```bash
$ ssh username@access.grid5000.fr
```

You can connect to all available sites via the internal DNS service. For example connecting to a specific site `lille`:
```bash
$ ssh lille
```
!!! tip
    You can connect from one node to all others.

### Grid5000 storage

All site storages are available on the `access` nodes via nfs mounted in the home directory. So if you need to transfer any files to specific sites use the directory in the access node.

```bash
scp file user@access.grid5000.fr:site
```
