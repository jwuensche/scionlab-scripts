# Introduction

Welcome to the ScionLab Testbed Documentation! This documentation covers how to setup and configure the following ScionLab AS testbeds:

 - [VirtualWall (via Fed4Fire)](./testbeds/virtual-wall.md)
 - [Grid5000 (via g5k tooling)](./testbeds/grid5000.md)
 - [ExoGeni (via Flukes)](./testbeds/exo-geni.md)
 - [DFN (via DFN-GVS)](./testbeds/dfn.md)
 - [GTS (bare metal servers managed directly by the GTS admins)](./testbeds/gts.md)

The documentation covers the initial account creation, tooling setup for GNU/Linux machines, testbed deployment, and machine preparation to fit the requirements of the ScionLab administrators. Additionally, the basic steps are outlines to perform a system upgrade on the testbeds machines.
